Soft skin, bright eyes, and the fluffiest fur on the block. The benefits of bathing aren’t just superficial; keeping your pet clean can also help prevent itching in dogs with allergies and heal inflamed skin and damaged hair.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A trip to the groomer can cost a pretty penny, but many of the tools you need to clean your dog are likely already in your own bathroom. Read on for your very own DIY guide to bathing and grooming your favorite roommate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, check the calendar: how often do you actually have to bathe your dog? A general guideline is that most dogs should be bathed at least once a month using dog shampoo or human baby shampoo to prevent their skin from becoming too dry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Factors like weather and daily activities can affect how often your pet needs to hop in the tub. If you and your dog like to go hiking or swimming during the summer, you may need to plan for a couple of extra baths per month. Your dogs may also appreciate a cool bath every other week in hotter months, especially if they spend a lot of time sweating outdoors.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before you get to scrubbing, there is some prep required. Begin by brushing your dog – it’ll make bath time a lot easier and more effective. If you’re using a bathtub, put a bath mat down to prevent slipping and fill the tub with about 3 to 4 inches of lukewarm water. Make sure it’s not too hot or too cold!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you place your pup in the tub, use a removable shower head or plastic cup to wet his or her fur. Gently apply shampoo until your dog is fully lathered, taking care to avoid the ears, nose, and eyes. Almost done! Make sure you remove all the shampoo before bringing out the towel, as any lingering remnants can lead to skin irritations. Use a towel or gentle blow dryer (make sure it’s on the cool to warm setting – not hot!) to dry your clean dog off. Administer a treat for good behavior.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Campaigning for pet parent of the year? Go the extra mile after bath time and pay attention to those eyes, ears, and nails.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Trimming your dog’s nails is actually not as difficult as you might think. To begin, use a pair of dull children’s scissors to clip any excess fur surrounding your dog’s nails. You’ll need a scissor-type clipper made especially for dogs for the next step.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Separate each individual nail using your finger and clip nails at a 45-degree angle. Clip only small sections of nail at a time, until you see the white inside and a small spot of black inside. Do not go any further than this point, as you can cut the quick and cause your dog to bleed. If this happens, you can use the corn starch at the end of the nail to stop the bleeding.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your dog tends to get&nbsp;<a href=\"https://digest.thefarmersdog.com/wikipup-6-ways-to-remedy-tear-stains/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stains or gunk around the eyes</a>, a quick clean will do wonders. To clean around your dog’s eyes, use a damp (and clean) soft sponge or washcloth and gently wipe around the eye area to help loosen and remove any build-up. Avoid using soap or shampoo near their eyes as it could lead to irritations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ear cleaning, the last frontier, is trickier than nail and eye cleaning. Dogs’ ears are very sensitive, and one wrong move can cause serious damage. Get your pup accustomed to ear cleaning by slowly associating it with something positive, like<a href=\"https://digest.thefarmersdog.com/top-14-dog-friendly-snacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;fresh treats.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once your dog is familiar with all the action around his ears, start using cotton balls – not swabs – and a dog-safe ear rinse. Wet the cotton ball with the ear rinse solution and start out wiping the outer part of their ear, followed by the inner section. Make sure not to go too far to avoid potential damage. Add ear cleaning to your weekly roster to prevent any dirt build-up or infections.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With a few key purchases, you’ll be able to keep your dog (and home) cleaner without trekking to a groomer.

Let’s take a closer look at the most common nutrient deficiencies that can result from an imbalanced homemade diet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Zinc</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Zinc has many essential functions in the body including protein synthesis, skin and wound healing, and stabilizing DNA/RNA structures and cell membranes. We told you it was essential. Although relatively non toxic, zinc can also interfere with the absorption of other minerals if consumed in large quantities, so as is the case with so much in life, balance is key.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Choline</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Choline plays a wide ranging role in your dog’s nutrition and can have a direct impact on liver function. This macronutrient is a structural part of cell membranes and lipoproteins, which are essential for lipid/fat transfer throughout the body. Over time, choline deficiencies can affect normal liver function and lead to the accumulation of fat in the liver.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Vitamins D &amp; E</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are two important forms of vitamin D: vitamin D2 (mainly found in plants) and vitamin D3 (which is found in fatty meats and liver). The primary function of vitamin D is to enhance intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus and maintain control of calcium homeostasis within the body.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Vitamin E is the major fat-soluble antioxidant present throughout the body and tissues and prevents oxidative damage to cell membranes and DNA/RNA structures. In other words, it’s pretty crucial. Research has shown that vitamin D deficiencies in dogs can lead to rickets and bone deformities, while vitamin E deficiencies manifest as degenerative muscle diseases associated with muscle weakness and reproductive failure. Don’t skimp on this duo.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Copper</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Copper is a trace mineral and is incorporated in a variety of proteins and enzymes which perform essential functions for your dog. These include the formation and maintenance of bone and connective tissue, the formation of red blood cells, and normal nerve fiber formation. Side effects of a copper deficiency include connective tissue disorders and loss of hair pigmentation. &nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA &amp; DHA</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These babies are a mouthful, but their purpose can be summarized in two words: brain function. &nbsp;Long chain omega 3 fatty acids (typically found in cold water fish and algae) are important cell membrane components involved in cell signaling and are essential for normal function of the brain and retina.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Calcium</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Calcium serves two major functions: it’s a structural component of bones and teeth and a cellular messenger involved in nerve impulse transmission. Low calcium levels in a dog’s blood — aka hypocalcemia — can become a serious condition resulting in spontaneous bone fractures and nerve damage. Diets containing mainly meat without additional calcium (hey chicken and rice, we’re looking at you) are a common cause of calcium deficiencies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So what’s the answer for the pet owner who’s on a mission to feed mindfully?

A very hazardous stretch of the run was also led by another dog named Togo, proving that dogs are better than humans at just about everything, including teamwork. Balto blazed the final leg of the trail through freezing cold and punishing conditions, delivering the life-saving serum in just six days. Despite a bit of controversy following the run over who deserved the most publicity (Balto vs Togo, a rivalry they were both blissfully unaware of), a bronze statue was ultimately erected in Balto’s honor in Central Park.

Ignore the puppy eyes and get informed: these are the top ten most dangerous foods you could feed your dog.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>Alcohol</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your dog may be drunk in love with you, but that’s the only kind of intoxication he needs. Think of your pup as that old college friend who can’t quite hold his liquor…only in this case your dog can’t tell you when he’s feeling queasy. Alcohol has the same effect on a dog’s liver and brain that it has on yours, but it can do big damage to a dog in much smaller quantities. Even a small amount of alcohol can cause vomiting, diarrhea, central nervous system depression, problems with coordination, difficulty breathing, comas, and even death. And just like humans, the smaller the dog, the greater the effect.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>Onions &amp; Garlic</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure your dog stays away from these two, and not just because of garlic breath. Garlic is a controversial ingredient; it has many medicinal purposes and it is an immune booster, but the potential risks outweigh the benefits. Both onion and garlic contain a substance that can damage and/or destroy a dog’s red blood cells, potentially leading to anemia. Did your dog scarf down the last onion ring when you weren’t looking? Keep an eye out: symptoms of anemia include weakness, pale gums, disinterest in food, dullness, and breathlessness. This risk is present in all forms of garlic and onion — raw, powdered, cooked, or dehydrated.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>Caffeine</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Does your dog need a little extra pep in his step in the morning? Try an invigorating AM jog, but don’t even think about sharing your Starbucks. Coffee can cause irreparable damage and even caffeine poisoning if consumed in large enough quantities. This risk extends from tea, coffee, and energy drinks to soda, cocoa, and even some painkillers. Symptoms of caffeine poisoning include restlessness, rapid breathing, heart palpitations, and muscle tremors, not entirely unlike how we feel after drinking two cold brews in one sitting.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>Grapes &amp; Raisins</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While some fruits are great healthy snack choices for your dog, grapes and raisins do not make the cut. They make look innocent, but these sweet snacks can cause vomiting, lethargy, and ultimately kidney failure in dogs. It’s unclear why grapes and raisins have this effect, but make sure your pup steers clear of the grapes on that cheese plate to be safe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>Macadamia Nuts</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Macadamia nuts may be an excellent source of dietary fiber for humans, but dogs should look elsewhere for their crunch. Although the prognosis for many cases is extremely good, these nuts can be fatal to dogs. Toxicosis depends on the size of the dog, but consumption of as little as 2.4 g/kg of macadamia nuts can cause clinical signs of poisoning, including muscle tremors, weakness, paralysis of the hindquarters, vomiting, fever, and rapid heartbeat. Combining these nuts with chocolate exacerbates clinical signs and increases the risk of death, so do everyone a favor and close that bag of&nbsp;white chocolate macadamia nut cookies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>Xylitol</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An artificial sweetener often found in candy, gum, toothpaste, and certain diet foods, this substance can have quick and traumatic consequences for your dog. Xylitol causes a sudden increase in insulin circulation that can result in a severe drop in blood sugar and even liver failure.

Ignore the puppy eyes and get informed: these are the top ten most dangerous foods you could feed your dog.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>Alcohol</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your dog may be drunk in love with you, but that’s the only kind of intoxication he needs. Think of your pup as that old college friend who can’t quite hold his liquor…only in this case your dog can’t tell you when he’s feeling queasy. Alcohol has the same effect on a dog’s liver and brain that it has on yours, but it can do big damage to a dog in much smaller quantities. Even a small amount of alcohol can cause vomiting, diarrhea, central nervous system depression, problems with coordination, difficulty breathing, comas, and even death. And just like humans, the smaller the dog, the greater the effect.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>Onions &amp; Garlic</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure your dog stays away from these two, and not just because of garlic breath. Garlic is a controversial ingredient; it has many medicinal purposes and it is an immune booster, but the potential risks outweigh the benefits. Both onion and garlic contain a substance that can damage and/or destroy a dog’s red blood cells, potentially leading to anemia. Did your dog scarf down the last onion ring when you weren’t looking? Keep an eye out: symptoms of anemia include weakness, pale gums, disinterest in food, dullness, and breathlessness. This risk is present in all forms of garlic and onion — raw, powdered, cooked, or dehydrated.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>Caffeine</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Does your dog need a little extra pep in his step in the morning? Try an invigorating AM jog, but don’t even think about sharing your Starbucks. Coffee can cause irreparable damage and even caffeine poisoning if consumed in large enough quantities. This risk extends from tea, coffee, and energy drinks to soda, cocoa, and even some painkillers. Symptoms of caffeine poisoning include restlessness, rapid breathing, heart palpitations, and muscle tremors, not entirely unlike how we feel after drinking two cold brews in one sitting.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>Grapes &amp; Raisins</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While some fruits are great healthy snack choices for your dog, grapes and raisins do not make the cut. They make look innocent, but these sweet snacks can cause vomiting, lethargy, and ultimately kidney failure in dogs. It’s unclear why grapes and raisins have this effect, but make sure your pup steers clear of the grapes on that cheese plate to be safe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>Macadamia Nuts</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Macadamia nuts may be an excellent source of dietary fiber for humans, but dogs should look elsewhere for their crunch. Although the prognosis for many cases is extremely good, these nuts can be fatal to dogs. Toxicosis depends on the size of the dog, but consumption of as little as 2.4 g/kg of macadamia nuts can cause clinical signs of poisoning, including muscle tremors, weakness, paralysis of the hindquarters, vomiting, fever, and rapid heartbeat. Combining these nuts with chocolate exacerbates clinical signs and increases the risk of death, so do everyone a favor and close that bag of&nbsp;white chocolate macadamia nut cookies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>Xylitol</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An artificial sweetener often found in candy, gum, toothpaste, and certain diet foods, this substance can have quick and traumatic consequences for your dog. Xylitol causes a sudden increase in insulin circulation that can result in a severe drop in blood sugar and even liver failure. Early symptoms include repeated vomiting, lethargy, and loss of coordination that can evolve into seizures. Liver failure from xylitol ingestion can occur within just a few days, so don’t forget to put the cap back on the toothpaste in the morning.

A very hazardous stretch of the run was also led by another dog named Togo, proving that dogs are better than humans at just about everything, including teamwork.

Wet the cotton ball with the ear rinse solution and start out wiping the outer part of their ear, followed by the inner section. Make sure not to go too far to avoid potential damage. Add ear cleaning to your weekly roster to prevent any dirt build-up or infections.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With a few key purchases, you’ll be able to keep your dog (and home) cleaner without trekking to a groomer.

It keeps you on track, motivates you to lace up your sneakers, and takes the monotony out of an otherwise boring solo treadmill session. But what about working out with your&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;best friend?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you re-commit to your health goals alongside your most supportive companion, you both reap the benefits. Studies show that&nbsp;people with canine companions are 34%&nbsp; more likely to get their recommended amount of weekly exercise in than those without pets, and the emotional connection we feel when we’re with our dogs also gives our workouts an extra boost. Dogs benefit from regular exercise too, as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/skinny-dogs-live-longer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">canine obesity</a>&nbsp;can significantly impact their overall health and quality of life.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are plenty of ways to combine real exercise (not just a requisite morning walk) with quality puppy time, so stick to your favorite activity or try a new workout every week.

Yoga (or “Doga”)</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yes, this is a thing. Doggie yoga, or doga, was created&nbsp;by&nbsp;yogi Suzy Teitelman&nbsp;in 2001 and has been booming&nbsp;in popularity ever since.&nbsp;Enthusiasts talk about the benefits of doga in the same way regular yogis do: it’s a solid 45 minutes of quiet and calm (something we don’t get a lot of in our daily lives) that allows you and your dog to reconnect. Dogs like to stretch as it is — we often see them in yogi poses after naps — and doga provides mutual stretching time. It can come with other benefits too; doga dogs are more open to being touched, which can help with grooming sessions&nbsp;and vet visits. It also teaches pups to calm down more easily, which can be great for more rambunctious dogs who maybe don’t&nbsp;<em>love&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/diy-guide-grooming-dog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bath time</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>2. Soccer</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not the most coordinated athlete? When it comes to a soccer match with your dog, coordination is optional. The goal here is just running, getting your dog to follow, and maybe having them nudge the ball back. Do a series of sprints: kick the ball and run after it, pup in tow. You can&nbsp;also try for a down-field dribble and encourage your dog to attempt&nbsp;a steal. It even works with a second human in the mix — one of you chases, while your dog runs with the other. Great cardio (and bonding) for all.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>3. Tennis</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Much like soccer, your pup can act as a ball boy while you’re practicing and retrieve those missed serve tosses for you. This is great for any size dog (while smaller ones may have some difficulty maneuvering, say, a soccer ball).&nbsp;<em>Insider tip</em>: keep&nbsp;a few extra tennis balls on hand in case of slobber. A wet ball doesn’t bounce!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>4. Fetch</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An age old classic, this activity provides an arm workout, cardio, and endurance training all in one. Throwing frisbees, especially heavier ones made for Ultimate Frisbee, is a great upper body workout and a dog favorite. Try tossing with both arms at once and see how many you can throw — and how many your dog will bring back!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>5. Hiking</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Low-level, short-distance&nbsp;<a href=\"http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/a-guide-to-hiking-with-your-dog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hikes</a>&nbsp;are a great form of exercise for both you and your dog.

Swimming</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Swimming is known to be one of the best full-body, low-impact workouts for anyone, dogs included. They call it the doggie paddle for a reason! Hit the lake or beach for some laps before it gets too chilly (depending on the weather where you live), and train your pup to follow if he’s comfortable swimming. If he needs a bit of extra incentive, you can try using a ball for him to retrieve. This is great for older dogs with joint issues.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>7.&nbsp;Sprints</strong><strong>&nbsp;(Doggie Dash)</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Going on long runs with your dog can be a great form of exercise if he or she has the endurance, but not all dogs have the stamina (or body) for prolonged runs. An alternative is to try sprints, which provide a quick and powerful cardio workout. Just make sure to rest in between sets and keep water on hand for your dog.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>8. Biking &amp; Blading</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rollerblading or biking instead of walking is&nbsp;an easy way to step (and spice) up your daily routine. Just be sure your dog is capable of covering longer distances before you start blading an hour from home.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>9. Long Walks On The Beach</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A romantic move no matter what season, walking on sand also builds core strength and works muscles that would otherwise get little use. If you want to take it up a notch, have your dog chase some waves (and make sure to pack a towel for the ride home).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>10. Stand-Up Paddle Board</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Already one of the best core workouts, “SUP-ing” (a little insider lingo for you!) gets even better if you bring your canine friend on board.

It keeps you on track, motivates you to lace up your sneakers, and takes the monotony out of an otherwise boring solo treadmill session. But what about working out with your&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;best friend?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you re-commit to your health goals alongside your most supportive companion, you both reap the benefits. Studies show that&nbsp;people with canine companions are 34%&nbsp; more likely to get their recommended amount of weekly exercise in than those without pets, and the emotional connection we feel when we’re with our dogs also gives our workouts an extra boost. Dogs benefit from regular exercise too, as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/skinny-dogs-live-longer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">canine obesity</a>&nbsp;can significantly impact their overall health and quality of life.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are plenty of ways to combine real exercise (not just a requisite morning walk) with quality puppy time, so stick to your favorite activity or try a new workout every week. Always remember to bring along enough water for both of you to protect your pup from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/dog-hydration-101/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dehydration</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>1. Yoga (or “Doga”)</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yes, this is a thing. Doggie yoga, or doga, was created&nbsp;by&nbsp;yogi Suzy Teitelman&nbsp;in 2001 and has been booming&nbsp;in popularity ever since.&nbsp;Enthusiasts talk about the benefits of doga in the same way regular yogis do: it’s a solid 45 minutes of quiet and calm (something we don’t get a lot of in our daily lives) that allows you and your dog to reconnect. Dogs like to stretch as it is — we often see them in yogi poses after naps — and doga provides mutual stretching time. It can come with other benefits too; doga dogs are more open to being touched, which can help with grooming sessions&nbsp;and vet visits. It also teaches pups to calm down more easily, which can be great for more rambunctious dogs who maybe don’t&nbsp;<em>love&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/diy-guide-grooming-dog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bath time</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>2. Soccer</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not the most coordinated athlete? When it comes to a soccer match with your dog, coordination is optional. The goal here is just running, getting your dog to follow, and maybe having them nudge the ball back. Do a series of sprints: kick the ball and run after it, pup in tow. You can&nbsp;also try for a down-field dribble and encourage your dog to attempt&nbsp;a steal. It even works with a second human in the mix — one of you chases, while your dog runs with the other. Great cardio (and bonding) for all.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>3. Tennis</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Much like soccer, your pup can act as a ball boy while you’re practicing and retrieve those missed serve tosses for you. This is great for any size dog (while smaller ones may have some difficulty maneuvering, say, a soccer ball).&nbsp;<em>Insider tip</em>: keep&nbsp;a few extra tennis balls on hand in case of slobber. A wet ball doesn’t bounce!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>4. Fetch</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An age old classic, this activity provides an arm workout, cardio, and endurance training all in one. Throwing frisbees, especially heavier ones made for Ultimate Frisbee, is a great upper body workout and a dog favorite. Try tossing with both arms at once and see how many you can throw — and how many your dog will bring back!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>5. Hiking</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Low-level, short-distance&nbsp;<a href=\"http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/a-guide-to-hiking-with-your-dog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hikes</a>&nbsp;are a great form of exercise for both you and your dog. More cardio than a normal walk but less taxing than a run, hikes also allow you both to get in a little nature time. New scenery for you,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mag.thefarmersdog.com/2017/03/22/the-importance-of-letting-your-dog-sniff/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new smells</a>&nbsp;for your pooch!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>6. Swimming</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Swimming is known to be one of the best full-body, low-impact workouts for anyone, dogs included. They call it the doggie paddle for a reason! Hit the lake or beach for some laps before it gets too chilly (depending on the weather where you live), and train your pup to follow if he’s comfortable swimming. If he needs a bit of extra incentive, you can try using a ball for him to retrieve. This is great for older dogs with joint issues.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>7.&nbsp;Sprints</strong><strong>&nbsp;(Doggie Dash)</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Going on long runs with your dog can be a great form of exercise if he or she has the endurance, but not all dogs have the stamina (or body) for prolonged runs. An alternative is to try sprints, which provide a quick and powerful cardio workout. Just make sure to rest in between sets and keep water on hand for your dog.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>8. Biking &amp; Blading</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rollerblading or biking instead of walking is&nbsp;an easy way to step (and spice) up your daily routine. Just be sure your dog is capable of covering longer distances before you start blading an hour from home.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>9. Long Walks On The Beach</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A romantic move no matter what season, walking on sand also builds core strength and works muscles that would otherwise get little use. If you want to take it up a notch, have your dog chase some waves (and make sure to pack a towel for the ride home).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>10. Stand-Up Paddle Board</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Already one of the best core workouts, “SUP-ing” (a little insider lingo for you!) gets even better if you bring your canine friend on board. Your dog will add a little extra weight while enjoying a scenic ride.
